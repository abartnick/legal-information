OpenGov Foundation EIN: 45-4848546Fundraising Response to Form 1023 Application; Part VIII, 4a 1. OpenGov Foundation will seek foundation grants and cooperative support from other charities in amounts greater than those received via web-based small-dollar donations.  Private corporate sponsorship of programs will be sought, especially for events and education programs, and OpenGov will strictly abide by Treasury Regulations dealing with advertising and corporate sponsorship. For example, OpenGov Foundation has already been offered a funding grant by the Knight Foundation to run a Madison Project beta test in one of their communities. The Knight Foundation is an 501 c(3) organization that supports “transformational ideas that promote quality journalism, advance media innovation, engage communities and foster the arts”. OpenGov Foundation will seek to receive such grants in the future from other foundations that share a similar aim.2. OpenGov plans to seek contributions from the general public via a small-dollar, Internet-based donations page on its website, www.opengovfoundation.org, and email solicitations.  OpenGov does not plan to hire a professional fundraising consultant, but instead will use its staff to assist in fundraising efforts.
